REQUIREMENTS:
* A relatively recently updated Windows 10 computer
* Administrator privileges for the user running the script
* All network adapters, besides one ethernet, to be disabled/disconnected
* __Several files that I'm not hosting or including because I have no idea what the licenses are and am not interested in taking that obligation on... BUT, they're easy to find. Grab them from this famous instructional page:__ https://www.bayareatechpros.com/ac1900-to-ac68u/

MAKE IT DO:
* verify you've collected all the files in one place (see below)
* right click badger.ps1 and "Run with PowerShell"
* if it opens in PowerShell ISE, you'll see the green-text note at the top saying to run it using the green play/triangle button
* however you run it, if it determines you need to do so, it will alert you that it will relaunch itself properly
